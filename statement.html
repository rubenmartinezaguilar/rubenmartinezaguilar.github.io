    </header>
    <p>I am an artist based in East San Jose, California. I was raised between two similar but different cultures, being born to a Guatemalan man and Mexican woman. And in my teen years, I opened my eyes and immersed myself into street punk and the ideas that come with it. With all these identities, my art follows vastly different time periods from Pre-Columbian Central America to Revolutionary Mexico to modern-day concrete jungles. With each period comes a different medium like charcoal and coffee to oil and acrylic paint to spray cans.</p>
<p>When making art, it is ideal that the medium can talk about the art piece. Charcoal and coffee are easily available resources produced in Guatemala. In the 20th Century, after the Mexican Revolution, artists like Orozco, Siqueiros, and Rivera took part in the creation of a new Mexican identity with their oil paintings and murals. An idea of punk is to be free and to rebel. With a can of spray paint, one can get their message across to a larger audience. The artists of these times are my ancestors and while not related by blood, we are related by spirit. It is a spirit I must keep alive. </p>
