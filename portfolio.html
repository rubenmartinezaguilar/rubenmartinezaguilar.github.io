<h3>Punketon, video collage, 2019</h3>
  <p>It’s a pure mash-up of multiple punk and metal shows. Coming from all angles, from high up in the balcony to down deep in the pit. The viewer gets to feel fast and loud rage without risking the bruises and scars. .</p>

  <h3>Techno Glitch, Glitch Art, 2019</h3>
  <p>The basis of my glitch piece was an owl Transformer at the disco. After running it through Audacity, subtle static was added, giving the illusion of laser beams around the owl’s head. </p>

  <h3>East L.A. Jam, Digital Composite, 2019</h3>
  <p>In my composite location, East Los Angeles got hit with some type of Space Jam magic. Cartoons and public figures inhabited the same universe. Chalino Sanchez and Austin Powers are standing off to the sidewalk.  Meanwhile, Jerry’s cousin is attempting to brutalize Spongebob and Patrick, but Fred Fredburger swoops in to save the day.</p>

  <h3>Welcome to the 3D Era, Net Art, 2019</h3>
  <p>Dark forces overtook the internet. May it be top secret government agencies or demonic entities, we are soon to be controlled. The internet is their tool to trap our minds to do their mysterious bidding. </p>
